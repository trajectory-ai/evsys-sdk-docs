# Putting it all together — Autoresearch! (/docs/autoresearch)



This page walks through the whole loop: **writing your own experiments with
Claude Code** (or any coding agent). The agent reads what's been tried, launches
a new training run on Tinker, scores it, records what happened, and iterates —
toward a small model that beats frontier on your task at a fraction of the cost.

Tinker-protocol infrastructure already made the hard part — GPUs, sharding, the
training loop — someone else's problem. What's left is *research*: which **data**
and which **recipe** win. That's the only thing the agent touches.

<ExperimentFlow />

## 1. Every experiment is standardised and stored [#1-every-experiment-is-standardised-and-stored]

For an agent to do research, it needs the **context of what's been tried**. So
every experiment carries two things:

* a **hypothesis** — why you're running it, set in `metadata.hypothesis`;
* a **conclusion** — what happened, auto-synthesized against your
  `success_metric` when the run finishes.

Both are recorded and centralized. A Claude Code session therefore *starts* by
pulling the hypotheses and conclusions of past experiments — it instantly knows
what's been tried and what worked, and proposes the next hypothesis. It doesn't
re-derive anything; it just reads the record.

```yaml
metadata:
  hypothesis: "Adding 2k deduped tool-call examples lifts pass@1 on the val set."
```

## 2. Launch an experiment [#2-launch-an-experiment]

The agent assembles one `ExperimentConfig`. It only ever controls the research —
the **data** and the **recipe** — and everything else is handled.

### Custom raw data [#custom-raw-data]

Point the config at a JSONL file; the agent curates what goes in (this is a
**data ablation** — the first lever):

```yaml
data:
  source_kind: jsonl
  path: data/train.jsonl
```

### Custom transforms [#custom-transforms]

Raw rows become standardized **data-format rows** through an ordered list of
`Transform`s. When the built-ins don't fit, the agent writes one — a class with
`name` + `Config` and the `rows -> rows` contract, registered with a decorator:

```python title="my_transform.py"
from pydantic import BaseModel
from evsys_sdk import register_transform

@register_transform("dedupe")
class Dedupe:
    name = "dedupe"
    class Config(BaseModel, extra="forbid"):
        key: str = "query"

    def __init__(self, **kw):
        self.cfg = self.Config(**kw)

    def __call__(self, rows):
        seen, out = set(), []
        for r in rows:
            if r.get(self.cfg.key) not in seen:
                seen.add(r.get(self.cfg.key)); out.append(r)
        return out
```

```yaml
data:
  transforms:
    - { kind: jsonl_to_chat, params: { user_template: "Query: {query}", assistant_template: "<answer>{tool_slug}</answer>" } }
    - { kind: dedupe, params: { key: query } }   # ← the agent's new transform
```

### Custom algorithm — any algorithm under the sun [#custom-algorithm--any-algorithm-under-the-sun]

The recipe is one method. `BaseAlgorithm` owns all the plumbing (backend, step &
save cadence, evaluators, the training loop, checkpointing) and **is itself a
StepBuilder*&#x2A; — a new algorithm only overrides &#x2A;*`build_batch()`** (and
optionally `setup` / `step_metrics`). The loss rides on the returned
`TrainingBatch`, so the agent writes only the heavy math — **any recipe, LoRA on
any model**:

```python title="my_algorithm.py"
from evsys_sdk import register_algorithm
from evsys_sdk.algorithms.sft import SFT

@register_algorithm("focal_sft")
class FocalSFT(SFT):
    name = "focal_sft"

    async def build_batch(self, step_idx):
        batch = await super().build_batch(step_idx)
        batch.loss_fn = my_focal_loss   # a client-side LossCallable
        return batch
```

```yaml
algorithm: { kind: focal_sft, params: { max_steps: 200, lora_rank: 8 } }
```

## 3. Train the model inside your harness (the agent plugin) [#3-train-the-model-inside-your-harness-the-agent-plugin]

Here's the powerful part for agentic workloads: the **rollout harness is itself
pluggable**. By default RL rolls out with a simple chat agent, but you can
register &#x2A;*any harbor `BaseAgent`** — a multi-turn, tool-using harness — and
point the algorithm at it:

```yaml
algorithm:
  kind: rl
  params:
    agent_import_path: my_project.agents.ToolUseAgent   # any harbor BaseAgent
```

The model then trains **inside that harness** — taking turns, calling your
tools, getting rewarded on the outcome — so it **learns to use the harness
itself**. This is exactly how Opus is trained inside the Claude Code harness:
register your harness, and the model you train learns to operate in it. The
agent harness is the third lever.

## 4. Validation & test — scored in the loop [#4-validation--test--scored-in-the-loop]

Every run is tied to real task performance by scoring it against benchmarks
under `metadata.benchmark`. Two **independent** knobs:

* **`run_every`** decides *when* an entry is scored: `run_every: N` scores it
  **in-loop every N steps**; omit `run_every` and it's scored **once, after
  training**. This applies to any entry.
* **`split`** (`val` / `test`) is just a **label** that namespaces the metrics so
  different benchmarks' scores stay apart in the logs — it does *not* decide
  when an entry runs. A `test` benchmark can run in-loop too; just give it a
  `run_every`.

```yaml
metadata:
  benchmark:
    - { name: val,  path: data/val,  run_every: 50,  metrics: [pass@1], split: val }   # in-loop every 50 steps
    - { name: test, path: data/test, run_every: 200, metrics: [pass@1], split: test }  # in-loop every 200 steps
```

In-loop evals run as **async rollouts** on Harbor's engine, so evaluation
overlaps training rather than stalling it.

## 5. Metrics — measure whatever you care about [#5-metrics--measure-whatever-you-care-about]

A benchmark's `metrics` come from the **metric registry**: score rollouts however
*you* define success — `pass@1`, `pass@3`, `pass^3`, or the economics that come
free from Harbor usage (**cost / time / tokens** per task).

```yaml
metrics: [pass@1, pass@3]    # plus cost / latency, or your own
```

The contract is one method — a metric receives the **per-task rewards** (one
inner list per task, one reward per sampled rollout) and returns a single
number. There's no `Config`; a metric takes no params:

```python
from typing import ClassVar, Sequence
from evsys_sdk import register_metric

@register_metric("pass@2")
class PassAt2:
    name: ClassVar[str] = "pass@2"          # the string you list in `metrics:`

    def compute(self, task_rewards: Sequence[Sequence[float]]) -> float:
        # task_rewards[i] = the rewards for task i's samples; reward >= 1.0 = a pass
        hits = sum(any(r >= 1.0 for r in task[:2]) for task in task_rewards)
        return hits / len(task_rewards)
```

## 6. Logging — local and dashboard [#6-logging--local-and-dashboard]

The agent *reads* its experiments through logging. Add either or both via
`callbacks`:

```yaml
callbacks:
  - { kind: local_logger }    # metrics.jsonl + predictions/ + summary.md + experiment.md
  - { kind: evsys_logger }    # push everything to the EvolvingSystems dashboard
```

* **`local_logger`** writes per-step `metrics.jsonl` (train + val rows, split
  tagged), `predictions/`, a per-run `summary.md`, **and*&#x2A; an experiment-level
  **`experiment.md` containing the hypothesis and the final conclusion** — so the
  whole research record lives on disk, no dashboard required.
* **`evsys_logger`** pushes the same record (metrics, predictions, hypothesis,
  conclusion) to the EvolvingSystems dashboard via `EVSYS_API_KEY` for a
  centralized, cross-experiment history.

## 7. Write the conclusion, then go again [#7-write-the-conclusion-then-go-again]

When the run finishes, the SDK scores the arms against your `success_metric&#x60;,
picks the &#x2A;*`best_arm`**, and synthesizes a **conclusion** — recorded right next
to the hypothesis (in `experiment.md` and/or the dashboard). Claude Code reads
that conclusion, updates its hypothesis, and launches the next experiment.

That's the autoresearch loop:

> **read past hypotheses + conclusions → form a hypothesis → launch → score →
> write a conclusion → repeat.**

A sweep makes each step wider: declare a `matrix` and one YAML expands into many
arms (run concurrently), so the agent searches learning rates and methods in
parallel and keeps the best:

```yaml
matrix:
  axes:
    algorithm.kind: [sft, focal_sft]
    algorithm.params.learning_rate: [1.0e-5, 1.0e-4]
base_run: { data: {...}, model: {...}, backend: { kind: tinker } }
```

## 8. Driving it with Claude Code [#8-driving-it-with-claude-code]

Load `evsys-sdk` as a **Claude Code plugin** and the agent gets skills + a
training agent that already know this whole flow, so it launches *better*
experiments instead of starting cold:

* **`set-up-research-project`** — scaffold a repo into the standard
  `data/ · src/ · experiments/ · .evsys/` layout.
* **`using-the-sdk`** — author correct configs, transforms, and algorithms.
* the &#x2A;*`training-decider`** agent — read prior context and materialize the next
  experiment end-to-end.
