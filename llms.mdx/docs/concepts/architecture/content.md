# Architecture (/docs/concepts/architecture)



`evsys-sdk` is organized around a single idea: **one `ExperimentConfig` (YAML)
drives everything**, and every `kind:` in it resolves through a registry.

## The Experiment — the organizing unit [#the-experiment--the-organizing-unit]

The **Experiment** is the top of the system. It's the scientific container: you
give it a hypothesis and one or more runs, and it produces a best arm and an
auto-synthesized conclusion. Concretely, `Experiment.run()`:

1. **Expands** the config — a single `run`, a list of `runs`, or a `matrix`
   shorthand — into one or more **arms** (each arm is one `RunConfig` = one
   training job). `n_repeats` replicates an arm across seeds for variance.
2. **Runs each arm** through the same pipeline — **Data → Training →
   Evaluation** — with per-arm failure isolation.
3. **Picks the best arm** by your `success_metric` and records an
   `ExperimentResult` (`best_arm`, `conclusion`, metrics).

So an experiment is *one YAML* that can fan out into a whole campaign of runs,
each of which is the left-to-right pipeline you saw on the
[introduction](/docs). Blue is what you author; white pillars and the grey
result are what the SDK owns.

## The five layers [#the-five-layers]

| Layer               | What it does                                                                          | Start here                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **① Experiment**    | The organizing unit — a hypothesis, one or more runs, an auto-synthesized conclusion. | [Experiments](/docs/concepts/experiments)     |
| **② Data**          | Raw sources → ordered transforms → standardized typed rows.                           | [Data](/docs/concepts/data)                   |
| **③ Algorithm**     | One contract — `train(ctx) -> RunResult` — over any tinker-compatible backend.        | [Algorithms](/docs/concepts/algorithms)       |
| **④ Evaluation**    | A test/validation firewall: `Benchmark` (once) vs `Validation` (in-loop).             | [Algorithms](/docs/concepts/algorithms)       |
| **⑤ Extensibility** | Eight registries — implement a protocol, register a `kind`, reference it in YAML.     | [Extensibility](/docs/concepts/extensibility) |
