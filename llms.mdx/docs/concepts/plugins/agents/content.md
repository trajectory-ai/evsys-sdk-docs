# Agents (/docs/concepts/plugins/agents)



An **agent** is the rollout harness for RL (and SDFT) — the harbor `BaseAgent`
that actually drives the model through a task, turn by turn, and records what
happened. It's pluggable on purpose: point at any harbor agent and the model
trains *inside* that harness, so it learns to use it. This is the same principle
as Opus being trained inside the Claude Code harness — the policy adapts to the
exact loop, tools, and message flow it will run under at inference time. You'd
write your own to train against a multi-turn loop, a tool-use protocol, or a
custom environment.

## The contract [#the-contract]

The default harness is `BasicLoopAgent` in
`src/evsys_sdk/training/harbor_agents.py`. It subclasses `BaseAgent` from
`harbor.agents.base`, which the rollout engine builds fresh per trial. The
methods a harbor `BaseAgent` implements (as `BasicLoopAgent` shows):

* **`@staticmethod name() -> str`** — the agent's harbor name
  (`"evsys-basic-loop"`). A static method returning a string.

* **`version(self) -> str | None`** — an optional version string (`"1.0.0"`).

* **`async setup(self, environment: BaseEnvironment) -> None`** — one-time prep
  before any rollout, given the environment harbor allocated (the SDK default is
  `NoOpEnvironment`, a sandbox-free in-process env). Returns nothing.

* **`async run(self, instruction: str, environment: BaseEnvironment, context: AgentContext) -> None`**
  The core method — one rollout for one task. This is what you override.
  * `instruction` — the task prompt (the templated `HarborTask.instruction`).
  * `environment` — the harbor environment to act in (exec/upload/download;
    no-op for in-process runs).
  * `context: AgentContext` — the object harbor harvests after the rollout. The
    agent **writes its results onto it**: `BasicLoopAgent` sets
    `context.rollout_details` (token-level data — present for tinker, empty for
    API models), plus `context.n_input_tokens`, `context.n_output_tokens`,
    `context.n_cache_tokens`, and `context.cost_usd` (usage/cost, harbor records
    these on the trial). It also writes the completion text to its agent dir so
    the host-side verifier can read and score it.
  * Returns nothing — all output flows through `context` and the agent dir.

`BasicLoopAgent.run` drives a `Chat(<llm>)` for `max_turns` turns. Its `__init__`
takes the kwargs the RL/SDFT engine passes through: `model_name`, `model_path`,
`renderer_name`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `max_turns`, `system_prompt`,
`model_client`, `api_base`. `model_client` picks the sampler: `"tinker"` (an
on-policy `TinkerLLM` reading the just-saved `model_path` — this is the path the
gradient flows back through) or `"litellm"` (any litellm provider, for
benchmarking closed/API models through the same harness).

## Use a built-in [#use-a-built-in]

There's one built-in harness; you select an alternative by pointing the RL
algorithm at any harbor agent's import path:

```yaml
algorithm:
  kind: rl
  params:
    agent_import_path: null      # null → the default BasicLoopAgent
    num_samples: 2
    max_turns: 1
    max_tokens: 256
    temperature: 1.0
```

When `agent_import_path` is `null`, the engine uses
`BasicLoopAgent`, parameterized by the rollout kwargs above. When you set it to a
`"module.path:ClassName"` string, **that agent wins and the engine passes it no
kwargs** — it must be fully self-configured.

| Built-in                              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BasicLoopAgent` (`evsys-basic-loop`) | Drives `Chat(TinkerLLM(model_path))` for `max_turns` turns on the current policy weights, records token-level `rollout_details` + usage/cost onto the `AgentContext`, and writes the completion for the host-side verifier. Switch `model_client` to `"litellm"` to benchmark an API model through the same path. |

## Create your own [#create-your-own]

A custom harness is any harbor `BaseAgent` whose `run` drives your loop and
writes the rollout onto the `AgentContext`:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from harbor.agents.base import BaseAgent
from harbor.environments.base import BaseEnvironment
from harbor.llms.chat import Chat
from harbor.llms.tinker import TinkerLLM
from harbor.models.agent.context import AgentContext


class ToolLoopAgent(BaseAgent):
    """A 5-turn tool-use harness the policy is trained inside."""

    def __init__(self, *, model_name: str, model_path: str | None = None,
                 renderer_name: str | None = None, **kw) -> None:
        super().__init__(**kw)
        self._model_name = model_name
        self._model_path = model_path
        self._renderer_name = renderer_name

    @staticmethod
    def name() -> str:
        return "tool-loop"

    def version(self) -> str | None:
        return "1.0.0"

    async def setup(self, environment: BaseEnvironment) -> None:
        return None

    async def run(self, instruction: str, environment: BaseEnvironment,
                  context: AgentContext) -> None:
        llm = TinkerLLM(                       # on-policy: reads current weights
            model_name=self._model_name,
            model_path=self._model_path,
            renderer_name=self._renderer_name,
            collect_rollout_details=True,      # token-level data for training
        )
        chat = Chat(llm)
        resp = await chat.chat(instruction)    # ... your multi-turn / tool loop
        context.rollout_details = chat.rollout_details   # what the gradient uses
        context.n_input_tokens = chat.total_input_tokens
        context.n_output_tokens = chat.total_output_tokens
        context.cost_usd = chat.total_cost
        logs_dir = getattr(self, "logs_dir", None)
        if logs_dir is not None:               # completion → verifier reads it
            Path(logs_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            (Path(logs_dir) / "completion.txt").write_text(resp.content or "")
```

```yaml
algorithm:
  kind: rl
  params:
    agent_import_path: my_pkg.agents:ToolLoopAgent   # train the policy inside it
    num_samples: 4
```

Because the engine hands a self-configured agent no kwargs, give your `__init__`
the defaults it needs to construct a sampler on the current policy.

## Ship it in a package [#ship-it-in-a-package]

A custom agent ships as an ordinary Python class — the RL config references it by
its `module.path:ClassName` import string, so any installed package (or your own
project module) works with no SDK fork. The engine imports it by that path at
rollout time, exactly as it imports the built-in `BasicLoopAgent`.
