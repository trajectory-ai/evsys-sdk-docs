# Callbacks (/docs/concepts/plugins/callbacks)



A **callback** is an object that gets called at fixed moments — when the
experiment starts, before/after each run, after every training step, on each
eval, on checkpoint, at the end. Callbacks are how logging, dashboards,
progress printing, and early stopping plug in without touching the loop. You
list them on `ExperimentConfig.callbacks`; you write your own when you need a
side effect (ship to S3, push to a service, stop early) the built-ins don't
cover.

Two safety properties matter: **a raising callback never kills the run** (the
exception is logged at WARNING and the next callback runs), and **every hook has
a no-op default** so you override only the ones you care about.

## The contract [#the-contract]

The base class is `evsys_sdk.training.callbacks.Callback`. There is no `Config`
requirement on the base, but built-ins carry `name` + `Config` ClassVars so they
work from YAML. Two kinds of state object are threaded in:

* **`LogState`** (called `LoopState` in code) — live training-loop state:
  `.step`, `.num_steps`, `.output_dir`, `.backend`, `.log_store`,
  `.checkpoint_mgr`, `.stop_requested`, `.ctx`. Call `state.request_stop()` from
  any loop hook to break the loop after the current step finishes.
* **`LogContext`** — experiment-wide context shared across all hooks:
  `.output_dir`, `.config`, `.store`, `.run_key`, `.run_config`, `.group_name`,
  `.ids` (dashboard ids populated by logger callbacks), `.extras` (scratch shared
  between callbacks within a run).

Here is **every hook**, with its exact signature and when it fires.

**Loop-scope hooks** (dispatched by the `TrainingLoop`):

* **`on_train_start(self, state: LoopState) -> None`** — once, before the for-loop
  starts. Open log files, init a wandb run, snapshot config.
* **`on_step_end(self, state: LoopState, step_idx: int, batch: TrainingBatch, metrics: dict[str, float]) -> None`**
  — after every train step's metric row is written. `step_idx` is the 0-based
  step; `batch` is the step's training batch; `metrics` is that step's metric
  dict. The universal per-step hook.
* **`on_eval(self, state: LoopState, step_idx: int, eval_name: str, metrics: dict[str, float]) -> None`**
  — once per evaluator after each in-loop eval. `eval_name` identifies the
  evaluator; `metrics` is its scalar output. Drives early stopping and val curves.
* **`on_checkpoint(self, state: LoopState, row: ManifestRow) -> None`** — after each
  checkpoint manifest row is recorded. `row` carries the checkpoint's name,
  step, and paths. Useful for shipping/pruning checkpoints.
* **`on_train_end(self, state: LoopState, artifacts: LoopArtifacts) -> None`** —
  once after the loop completes (including the final checkpoint save).
  `artifacts` carries totals (requested steps, train seconds, run dir,
  checkpoints). Flush summaries, close files.

**Experiment-scope hooks** (dispatched by the `Experiment`, not the loop — these
let one logger own the full lifecycle, threading dashboard ids through
`ctx.ids`):

* **`on_experiment_start(self, ctx: LogContext) -> None`** — once at experiment
  start, before any arm. A logger creates the experiment record here and sets
  `ctx.ids['experiment_id']`.
* **`on_group_start(self, ctx: LogContext, group_name: str) -> None`** — when a new
  run-group is needed (`n_repeats` replicates or continual stages). A logger
  creates the group → `ctx.ids[f'group:{group_name}']`.
* **`on_run_start(self, ctx: LogContext) -> None`** — per arm, before training.
  `ctx.run_config` is set. A logger opens its run-scoped sink (e.g. `wandb.init`)
  → `ctx.ids['run_id']`, reading the parent ids to link it.
* **`on_benchmark_eval(self, ctx: LogContext, eval_result: EvalResult, predictions: list[dict], *, step: int | None = None) -> None`**
  — per benchmark scored, in-loop (`step` = the train step) or post-training
  (`step=None`). `eval_result` carries metrics + breakdowns + tags; `predictions`
  is the per-task prediction rows. `step` is **keyword-only**.
* **`on_run_end(self, ctx: LogContext, run_result: RunResult, arm: ArmResult) -> None`**
  — per arm, after eval, before the run is marked completed. `run_result` is the
  algorithm's result; `arm` is the arm record. Loggers close their sink and
  record final status here.
* **`on_experiment_end(self, ctx: LogContext, result: ExperimentResult) -> None`** —
  once at experiment end. `result` carries `best_arm`, `best_score`, `status`,
  `conclusion`. Final summary / flush.

## Use a built-in [#use-a-built-in]

```yaml
callbacks:
  - kind: local_logger
    params: { print_every: 10 }
  - kind: early_stopping
    params: { metric: pass_rate, eval_name: val, patience: 3 }
```

| Built-in             | What it does / where it writes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `print_progress`     | Compact one-liner per step to stdout. Params: `every` (print every Nth step), `keys` (restrict printed metric keys).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `csv_metrics`        | Mirrors per-step metric writes into a CSV next to `metrics.jsonl`. Params: `out_path` (parent created if missing), `delimiter` (default `,`). New metric keys append columns.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `early_stopping`     | Watches a metric on `on_eval` and calls `state.request_stop()` after N evals without improvement. Params: `metric`, `eval_name` (or `None` = any), `patience` (default 3), `mode` (`max`/`min`), `min_delta`.                                                                                                                                   |
| `wandb_logger`       | One Weights & Biases run per arm (opened `on_run_start`, closed `on_run_end`). Logs per-step + eval + benchmark metrics and a predictions `wandb.Table`. wandb is imported lazily; if missing, every hook no-ops. Surfaces the run URL on `ctx.extras['wandb_url']`. Params: `project`, `entity`, `name`, `mode`, `log_every`, `max_pred_rows`. |
| `tensorboard_logger` | One TensorBoard event dir per arm. Logs scalar + eval + benchmark metrics via `SummaryWriter`. Lazy torch import; no-ops if missing. Params: `log_dir` (default `<output_dir>/tb/<run_key>`), `flush_secs`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `local_logger`       | Human-readable local mirror — see exact outputs below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `evsys_logger`       | "Callbacks own the store" mode: persists experiment/group/run records, per-step metrics, checkpoints, benchmark evals + predictions to the evsys dashboard, keyed off `ctx.ids`. Disables itself if the `Experiment` already has a `store=` (to avoid double-writes). Params: `project_id`, `flush_every`.                                      |
| `debug_logger`       | Pretty-prints every hook and its arguments to stdout — pure introspection, no persistence. Drop it in to see exactly what each logger callback receives and in what order. Params: `max_len`, `max_pred_rows`.                                                                                                                                  |

### What `local_logger` writes, exactly [#what-local_logger-writes-exactly]

`LocalLoggerCallback` both prints a per-step one-liner (cadence `print_every`,
`0` = silent) and persists files:

* **`<output_dir>/<run_key>/metrics.jsonl`** — appended on every `on_step_end`
  (split `"train"`) and `on_eval` (split `"val"`). Each row is
  `{step, split, metrics}`.
* **`<output_dir>/<run_key>/predictions/<name>.jsonl`** — written per benchmark in
  `on_benchmark_eval` when predictions are present (`<name>` is the eval name,
  slashes/spaces sanitized), one prediction row per line.
* **`<output_dir>/<run_key>/summary.md`** — written at `on_run_end`: the run key,
  the hypothesis (echoed in the header), final status, and one line per benchmark
  eval with its metrics.
* **`<output_dir>/experiment.md`** — the experiment-level mirror: the hypothesis
  (read from `ctx.config.metadata['hypothesis']` at `on_experiment_start`) and
  the conclusion (from `ExperimentResult.conclusion` at `on_experiment_end`). So
  the local mirror carries hypothesis + conclusion even with no dashboard.

## Create your own [#create-your-own]

Subclass `Callback`, override only the hooks you need, carry `name` + `Config`,
and decorate with `@register_callback("<name>")`:

```python
from typing import ClassVar
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
from evsys_sdk.training.callbacks import Callback
from evsys_sdk.registry import register_callback


class SlackNotifyConfig(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")
    webhook_url: str


@register_callback("slack_notify")
class SlackNotifyCallback(Callback):
    name: ClassVar[str] = "slack_notify"        # the YAML `kind`
    Config: ClassVar[type] = SlackNotifyConfig

    def __init__(self, *, webhook_url: str) -> None:
        self.webhook_url = webhook_url

    def on_experiment_end(self, ctx, result) -> None:
        import requests
        best = getattr(getattr(result, "best_arm", None), "name", None)
        requests.post(self.webhook_url, json={
            "text": f"Experiment done — best arm {best}, score {getattr(result, 'best_score', None)}",
        })
```

Then list it on the experiment:

```yaml
callbacks:
  - kind: slack_notify
    params:
      webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

## Ship it in a package [#ship-it-in-a-package]

Callbacks are constructed from `{kind, params}` specs via `build_callbacks`,
which validates `params` against your `Config` and resolves `kind` through the
callback registry. To distribute a callback without copying code, import the
module that runs your `@register_callback` decorator at startup (e.g. from your
project's package `__init__`). Note callbacks are **not** among the entry-point
groups `evsys_sdk` auto-loads (those cover algorithms, verifiers, metrics, data
stores, log stores, backends, inference, transforms) — so ensure your
registering module is imported before the experiment runs.
