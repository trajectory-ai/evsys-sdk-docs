# Metrics (/docs/concepts/plugins/metrics)



A **metric** reduces a benchmark's raw rewards to a single number. A benchmark
scores each task by running its verifier on `num_samples` rollouts, producing a
list of per-sample rewards per task; a metric takes that whole `list[list[float]]`
and returns one float (`pass_rate`, `pass@3`, …). You list metrics by name on a
benchmark and write your own when you need a reduction the built-ins don't cover.

## The contract [#the-contract]

Defined in `src/evsys_sdk/protocols.py` as `class Metric(Protocol)`. A metric is
simpler than the other plugins — it has &#x2A;*no `Config`** (metrics take no params):

* **`name: ClassVar[str]`** — registry key; the string you put on a benchmark's
  `metrics:` list.
* **`def compute(self, task_rewards: Sequence[Sequence[float]]) -> float`** — the
  one method. `task_rewards` is a sequence of sequences: **one inner sequence per
  task**, holding that task's per-sample rewards. (So `task_rewards[i][j]` is the
  reward of sample `j` on task `i`.) It returns a single `float` — the aggregated
  score for the benchmark. A sample is treated as "passing" when its reward
  clears `PASS_THRESHOLD` (`1.0`, defined in `metrics/basic.py`).

## Use a built-in [#use-a-built-in]

```yaml
benchmark:
  num_samples: 3
  metrics: [pass_rate, pass@1, pass@3]
```

| Built-in      | What it does                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mean_reward` | **Macro** mean reward: for each task take the mean of its samples, then average those task-means. Empty tasks are skipped; returns `0.0` if there are none. |
| `avg`         | Alias of `mean_reward` (same `compute`, different name).                                                                                                    |
| `pass_rate`   | **Micro** pass rate: total passing samples ÷ total samples, pooled across all tasks (`0.0` if no samples).                                                  |
| `pass@1`      | Fraction of tasks where **any** of the first **1** sample passes.                                                                                           |
| `pass@3`      | Fraction of tasks where **any** of the first **3** samples passes (`any(_passes(r) for r in rs[:3])`).                                                      |
| `pass^3`      | "pass-hat-3" / consistency: fraction of tasks where **all** of the first **3** samples pass.                                                                |

> **Economics metrics come free, separately.** Per-task **time, tokens, and
> cost** are *not* part of this metric registry. They are harbor-native: they
> come from each rollout's usage (surfaced via `Trajectory.metadata['usage']`
> and aggregated into eval metrics), so you get them automatically without
> registering or listing anything. The metric registry here is only for reducing
> *rewards* to a scalar.

## Create your own [#create-your-own]

```python
from typing import ClassVar, Sequence

from evsys_sdk.registry import register_metric

PASS = 1.0


@register_metric("worst_task")       # registry key == name on metrics: list
class WorstTask:
    name: ClassVar[str] = "worst_task"
    # No Config — metrics take no params.

    # One inner sequence per task; returns one scalar for the benchmark.
    def compute(self, task_rewards: Sequence[Sequence[float]]) -> float:
        tasks = [rs for rs in task_rewards if rs]   # drop empty tasks
        if not tasks:
            return 0.0
        # Each task's mean sample reward; report the lowest (the weakest task).
        means = [sum(rs) / len(rs) for rs in tasks]
        return min(means)
```

```yaml
benchmark:
  num_samples: 3
  metrics: [mean_reward, worst_task]
```

## Ship it in a package [#ship-it-in-a-package]

Register a metric from a separate pip package via the entry-point group
`evsys_sdk.metrics` in its `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."evsys_sdk.metrics"]
worst_task = "my_pkg.metrics:WorstTask"
```

`evsys_sdk` walks that group on import and runs the `@register_metric` decorator.
