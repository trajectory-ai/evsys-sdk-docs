# Transforms (/docs/concepts/plugins/transforms)



A **transform** is a small, named function-object that rewrites the rows of a
dataset. Raw data on disk (`{query, answer, ...}`) almost never matches the
shape an algorithm wants (`{messages: [...]}`); transforms bridge that gap. You
list them on a dataset, they run **in order**, and each one takes the rows the
previous one emitted. Write your own when your raw data has a layout no built-in
knows how to read.

## The contract [#the-contract]

The protocol lives in `src/evsys_sdk/protocols.py` as `class Transform(Protocol)`.
A transform is any object that declares two class vars and is *callable*:

* **`name: ClassVar[str]`** — the registry key. This is the exact string you put
  as `kind:` in YAML.
* **`Config: ClassVar[type]`** — a Pydantic model (with `extra="forbid"`)
  describing the transform's params. The factory validates the `params:` block
  from YAML against this model before constructing the transform, so an unknown
  or mistyped param fails loudly instead of being silently ignored.
* **`def __call__(self, rows: Iterable[dict[str, Any]]) -> Iterable[dict[str, Any]]`**
  — the one method. It receives `rows`, an iterable of plain dicts (one dict per
  data row, exactly as read from the JSONL/parquet source or as emitted by the
  previous transform), and returns an iterable of dicts. There is no fixed schema
  on the dicts — keys are whatever your data has. The convention is **additive**:
  keep the original keys and add new ones (`yield {**row, "messages": ...}`) so a
  later transform or the algorithm can still see the source fields. Returning a
  generator is fine and encouraged — rows stream through lazily.

Because transforms are chained, the *output row shape of one transform is the
input row shape of the next*. The last transform in the list must emit rows in
whatever standardized shape the algorithm expects (e.g. SFT wants a `messages`
list; an RL data path wants `HarborTask`-shaped rows).

## Use a built-in [#use-a-built-in]

```yaml
data:
  dataset_name: my_corpus
  transforms:
    - kind: jsonl_to_chat
      params:
        system_prompt: "You are a careful math tutor."
        user_template: "{query}"
        assistant_template: "{answer}"
```

| Built-in        | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jsonl_to_chat` | Turns each raw row into `{..., "messages": [...]}`. Adds a `system` message if `system_prompt` is set, a `user` message from `user_template.format(**row)`, and — if `assistant_template` is given (SFT) — an `assistant` message from `assistant_template.format(**row)`. Templates are Python format strings whose `{field}` placeholders pull from the row's keys. |
| `identity`      | Pass-through: returns the rows unchanged (`iter(rows)`). Useful for tests or when raw data is already in the right shape. Its `Config` has no fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Create your own [#create-your-own]

```python
from typing import Any, ClassVar, Iterable

from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

from evsys_sdk.registry import register_transform


class PrefixConfig(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")  # reject unknown params
    field: str = "query"          # which row key to prefix
    prefix: str = "Q: "           # text to prepend


@register_transform("prefix_query")          # registry key == YAML kind
class PrefixQueryTransform:
    name: ClassVar[str] = "prefix_query"
    Config: ClassVar[type] = PrefixConfig

    # The factory constructs you with the validated Config fields as kwargs.
    def __init__(self, *, field: str = "query", prefix: str = "Q: ") -> None:
        self.field = field
        self.prefix = prefix

    # Receives raw rows, yields rewritten rows. Stay additive: keep all keys.
    def __call__(
        self, rows: Iterable[dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> Iterable[dict[str, Any]]:
        for row in rows:
            yield {**row, self.field: f"{self.prefix}{row[self.field]}"}
```

Then reference it by its registered name in YAML:

```yaml
data:
  dataset_name: my_corpus
  transforms:
    - kind: prefix_query
      params: {field: query, prefix: "Question: "}
    - kind: jsonl_to_chat
      params: {user_template: "{query}", assistant_template: "{answer}"}
```

## Ship it in a package [#ship-it-in-a-package]

To register a transform from a separate pip package (no SDK edit, no import in
your project), declare a Python **entry point** under the group
`evsys_sdk.transforms` in that package's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."evsys_sdk.transforms"]
prefix_query = "my_pkg.transforms:PrefixQueryTransform"
```

On import, `evsys_sdk` walks that group and loads each target, running its
`@register_transform` decorator.
