# Introduction (/docs)



We believe there will not be a few generally intelligent models that everyone
uses, but **thousands of models adapted for every task**, continually learning
from every interaction. To enable this we need infrastructure that lets
**coding agents launch experiments, learn from them, and train models that
learn continuously**. `evsys-sdk` is the first step toward that.

This is the whole point of `evsys-sdk`: &#x2A;*turn your favourite coding agent into
a model lab.**

To enable autoresearch we need **standardisation** of experiments — and
`evsys-sdk` standardises every experiment while staying flexible enough to run
**any algorithm on any data**.

Tinker-protocol training infrastructure has made the hard part — provisioning
GPUs, sharding, the training loop — someone else's problem. What's left is the
*research*: which **data** and which **recipe** produce a model that wins on
your task. `evsys-sdk` makes that research the only thing you (and your agent)
touch, and standardizes + centralizes every experiment so the agent always has
the context of what's been tried.

So the loop becomes: your coding agent — **Claude Code**, **Codex**, anything —
writes a config, launches it on the tinker backend, reads the structured
result, and writes the next one. Run a series of educated experiments and you
land a small, task-specific model that **beats frontier on your task at a
fraction of the cost** — driven entirely by the agent.

An experiment is a single YAML file.

    #### 🧑‍💻 Coding agents customise [#-coding-agents-customise]

    * **Data ablations** — what data goes into training (sources, mixes, transforms).
    * **Algorithmic changes** — only the heavy math: override `build_batch()` and the loss.

    #### ⚙️ The SDK handles everything else [#️-the-sdk-handles-everything-else]

    * **Experiment orchestration** — sweeps, arms, seeds, failure isolation, conclusions.
    * **Data** — loading, caching & lineage → data format rows.
    * **The training loop** — forward/backward, optimizer steps, save cadence.
    * **Checkpointing & artifacts.**
    * **Evaluation** — in-loop validation + benchmark scoring, metrics & verifiers.
    * **Backends & compute** — mock / local / tinker, rollouts via Harbor.
    * **Logging, dashboard & storage.**

## What you can plug in [#what-you-can-plug-in]

Every moving part is a registry: reference a built-in by name in the YAML, or
register your own with a one-line `@register_*` decorator — no fork.

* **Tinker-compatible backends** — train on anything that exposes the Tinker
  training server: Fireworks, TML, SkyRL, … one line in the config switches provider.
* **Algorithms** — any recipe under the sun (SFT, RL, distillation, or your
  own), LoRA on any model — defined by overriding a single `build_batch()`.
* **Agent harnesses** — train a model *inside* your own multi-turn harness (any
  harbor `BaseAgent`) so it learns to use your tools — the way Opus is trained
  inside the Claude Code harness.
* **Transforms** — turn any raw data into the standard data-format rows; chain
  built-ins or register your own.
* **Verifiers** — the reward / correctness check for RL and eval
  (`exact_match`, `contains`, LLM-judge, or custom).
* **Metrics** — score rollouts however you measure success: `pass@1`, `pass@3`,
  cost, latency, your own.
* **Validation & evaluation** — score against benchmarks via `metadata.benchmark`:
  `run_every: N` scores in-loop every N steps (omit it to score once after
  training); the `split` tag (`val`/`test`) just separates the metrics.
* **Inference clients** — how eval / RL query a model to generate.
* **Data & log stores** — where data is read and where metrics/artifacts are
  written (local files, the dashboard, TensorBoard).
* **Callbacks** — hook the training lifecycle for logging, early stopping, or
  dashboard upload.
* **Deployers** — ship the trained adapter (e.g. Fireworks) with one line.
