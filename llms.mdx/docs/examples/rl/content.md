# RL — Reinforcement Learning (/docs/examples/rl)



A full walkthrough of on-policy RL for a beginner. Unlike SFT there's no "right
answer" to copy — the model **tries**, a **verifier scores the attempt**, and the
reward pushes the policy toward higher-scoring answers. We'll teach a model to
solve simple arithmetic and put the answer in `<answer></answer>`.

Runnable in the repo at &#x2A;*`examples/rl_walkthrough/`**.

## 1. The raw data — tasks you point the config at [#1-the-raw-data--tasks-you-point-the-config-at]

RL data is a **JSONL file*&#x2A; of &#x2A;*`HarborTask`** rows. Each line is a task: an
`instruction` (the prompt the model attempts) and a `verifier` (how to score the
attempt):

```json title="examples/rl_walkthrough/data/train.jsonl"
{"task_id": "t0", "instruction": "What is 2 + 2? Put the final answer inside <answer></answer>.", "verifier": {"kind": "in_process", "fn_name": "contains", "expected": "<answer>4</answer>"}}
{"task_id": "t1", "instruction": "What is 3 + 5? Put the final answer inside <answer></answer>.", "verifier": {"kind": "in_process", "fn_name": "contains", "expected": "<answer>8</answer>"}}
```

Point the config at the file — same as SFT:

```yaml
data:
  source_kind: jsonl
  path: examples/rl_walkthrough/data/train.jsonl
```

**No transform is needed here.** A row with `task_id` + `instruction` +
`verifier` is *already* a `HarborTask`, so the SDK detects the format directly.
(If your raw data were plain QA, you'd write a `@register_transform` that builds
these task dicts — same idea as SFT's `jsonl_to_chat`.)

## 2. The verifier IS the reward [#2-the-verifier-is-the-reward]

This is the heart of RL. Each task carries an **in-process verifier**:

```yaml
verifier: { kind: in_process, fn_name: contains, expected: "<answer>4</answer>" }
```

* `fn_name` is a built-in reward function — `contains`, `exact_match`,
  `regex_match`, or `tool_calls_match`.
* `expected` is what it checks the model's completion for.

When training runs, the policy **rolls out** on `instruction` (generates an
answer), and the verifier returns a reward (here: 1.0 if the completion contains
`<answer>4</answer>`, else 0.0). That reward is the entire learning signal — no
gold completion is ever shown to the model.

## 3. The built-in `rl` algorithm [#3-the-built-in-rl-algorithm]

Select `rl` by `kind`. Rollouts are executed by **Harbor's engine**;
`num_samples: 2` generates two attempts per task so the algorithm can compute a
**group-relative advantage** (which attempt beat the other) as its baseline:

```yaml
model:   { name: Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B }
backend: { kind: tinker }
algorithm:
  kind: rl
  params:
    learning_rate: 1.0e-5
    max_steps: 2            # bump to 100-500 for a real run
    batch_size: 1
    lora_rank: 1
    num_samples: 2          # >=2 turns on the advantage baseline
    max_tokens: 256
    user_template: "{prompt}"
```

## 4. Benchmarks & validation — score it *during* training [#4-benchmarks--validation--score-it-during-training]

Exactly like SFT: a benchmark is a **directory** with a `tasks.jsonl` of
verifier-scored tasks, attached under `metadata.benchmark` with a `run_every` so
it's scored **in-loop every N steps**:

```yaml
metadata:
  benchmark:
    - name: val
      path: examples/rl_walkthrough/data/val   # directory holding tasks.jsonl
      run_every: 1          # score every step
      metrics: [pass@1]      # fraction of held-out tasks solved
      split: val
```

`run_every: N` scores the benchmark **in-loop every N steps**; omit `run_every`
and it's scored **once, after training** (any entry — a `test` benchmark can run
in-loop too). `split` (`val` / `test`) is just a label that keeps different
benchmarks' metrics apart in the logs; it doesn't decide when an entry runs.

## 5. Local logging — where the metrics show up [#5-local-logging--where-the-metrics-show-up]

Same `local_logger` callback as everywhere:

```yaml
callbacks:
  - kind: local_logger
    params: { print_every: 1 }
```

It writes to `examples/rl_walkthrough/outputs/rl_arithmetic/`:

| File                    | What's in it                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metrics.jsonl`         | per-step rows `{step, split, metrics}` — train rows carry `reward/mean` and friends (`split: "train"`); in-loop val rows carry `val/val/pass@1` (`split: "val"`) |
| `predictions/val.jsonl` | the model's actual rollout for each val task                                                                                                                     |
| `summary.md`            | final status + per-eval metric lines                                                                                                                             |

Train rows carry `reward/mean` (`split: "train"`); in-loop val rows carry
`val/val/pass@1` (`split: "val"`). As the policy learns, you watch `reward/mean`
rise.

## 6. Run it [#6-run-it]

```bash
evsys validate examples/rl_walkthrough/config.yaml --deep    # offline check
export TINKER_API_KEY=...
python examples/rl_walkthrough/run.py
```

```text
Status:    completed
Metrics:   {'reward/mean': ...}
Logs:      examples/rl_walkthrough/outputs (metrics.jsonl, predictions/, summary.md)
```
