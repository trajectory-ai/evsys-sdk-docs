# SDFT — Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (/docs/examples/sdft)



A full walkthrough of self-distillation for a beginner. The trick: there's **no
separate, larger teacher model**. The same base model — shown the gold answer as
an in-context hint — acts as the teacher, and the student is trained to match the
teacher's *answer-aware* distribution while rolling out on its own. We'll teach a
model to answer capital-city questions.

Runnable in the repo at &#x2A;*`examples/sdft_walkthrough/`**.

## 1. The raw data — prompts you point the config at [#1-the-raw-data--prompts-you-point-the-config-at]

SDFT data is a **JSONL file*&#x2A; of &#x2A;*`PromptExample`** rows: a question and the
gold answer the teacher (not the student) is allowed to see:

```json title="examples/sdft_walkthrough/data/train.jsonl"
{"inputs": {"question": "What is the capital of France?"}, "expected": "Paris"}
{"inputs": {"question": "What is the capital of Japan?"}, "expected": "Tokyo"}
```

Point the config at the file:

```yaml
data:
  source_kind: jsonl
  path: examples/sdft_walkthrough/data/train.jsonl
```

**No transform is needed** — `{inputs: {question}, expected}` is already a
`PromptExample`, so the SDK detects the format directly. (As always, you could
write a `@register_transform` if your raw data came in a different shape.)

## 2. How the teacher works (no extra config) [#2-how-the-teacher-works-no-extra-config]

There's no teacher model to configure — it's &#x2A;*built automatically from
`model.name`**. Each step:

1. The **student** rolls out on the question on-policy (its own current answer).
2. A frozen **teacher** — the same base model, but shown the gold `expected`
   answer as an in-context demo — scores the rollout's **top-K** next-token
   distribution. That's "what a model that knew the answer would say."
3. The student is **CE-distilled** toward that teacher distribution.

`topk` controls how many teacher tokens are distilled per step. `user_template`
(`"{question}"`) renders the prompt the student rolls out on.

## 3. The built-in `sdft` algorithm [#3-the-built-in-sdft-algorithm]

```yaml
model:   { name: Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B }
backend: { kind: tinker }
algorithm:
  kind: sdft
  params:
    learning_rate: 1.0e-4
    max_steps: 2            # bump to 100-500 for a real run
    batch_size: 1
    lora_rank: 1
    topk: 20                # how many teacher tokens are distilled per step
    user_template: "{question}"
```

## 4. Benchmarks & validation — score it *during* training [#4-benchmarks--validation--score-it-during-training]

Identical to the other two: a benchmark **directory** with a verifier-scored
`tasks.jsonl`, attached under `metadata.benchmark` with a `run_every` so it's
scored **in-loop every N steps**:

```json title="examples/sdft_walkthrough/data/val/tasks.jsonl"
{"task_id": "val_0", "instruction": "What is the capital of Germany? Answer with just the city name.", "verifier": {"kind": "in_process", "fn_name": "contains", "expected": "Berlin"}}
```

```yaml
metadata:
  benchmark:
    - name: val
      path: examples/sdft_walkthrough/data/val   # directory holding tasks.jsonl
      run_every: 1
      metrics: [pass@1]
      split: val
```

`run_every: N` scores the benchmark **in-loop every N steps**; omit `run_every`
and it's scored **once, after training** (any entry — a `test` benchmark can run
in-loop too). `split` (`val` / `test`) is just a label that keeps different
benchmarks' metrics apart in the logs; it doesn't decide when an entry runs.

## 5. Local logging — where the metrics show up [#5-local-logging--where-the-metrics-show-up]

Same `local_logger` callback, writing to
`examples/sdft_walkthrough/outputs/sdft_capitals/`:

| File                    | What's in it                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metrics.jsonl`         | per-step rows `{step, split, metrics}` — train rows carry `train/mean_loss` (`split: "train"`); in-loop val rows carry `val/val/pass@1` (`split: "val"`) |
| `predictions/val.jsonl` | the student's answer for each val question                                                                                                               |
| `summary.md`            | final status + per-eval metric lines                                                                                                                     |

```json
{"step": 1, "split": "train", "metrics": {"train/mean_loss": ...}}
{"step": 1, "split": "val",   "metrics": {"val/val/pass@1": ...}}
```

## 6. Run it [#6-run-it]

```bash
evsys validate examples/sdft_walkthrough/config.yaml --deep    # offline check
export TINKER_API_KEY=...
python examples/sdft_walkthrough/run.py
```

```text
Status:    completed
Metrics:   {'train/mean_loss': ...}
Logs:      examples/sdft_walkthrough/outputs (metrics.jsonl, predictions/, summary.md)
```
