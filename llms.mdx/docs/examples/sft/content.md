# SFT — Supervised Fine-Tuning (/docs/examples/sft)



This is a full walkthrough for someone who has never used the SDK. We'll train a
small model to pick the right tool for a user's query — emitting
`<answer>TOOL_SLUG</answer>` — and explain **every** moving part: the raw data,
the transform that shapes it, the built-in algorithm, in-loop validation, and
where the logs land.

Everything here is a real, runnable example in the repo at
&#x2A;*`examples/sft_walkthrough/`**. You can run it directly (see [step 6](#6-run-it)).

## 1. The raw data — JSONL rows you point the config at [#1-the-raw-data--jsonl-rows-you-point-the-config-at]

Training data is a **JSONL file**: one JSON object per line. You bring whatever
shape your data is in — here, each line is a query and the tool that answers it:

```json title="examples/sft_walkthrough/data/train.jsonl"
{"query": "save a contact from this email", "tool_slug": "OUTLOOK_CREATE_CONTACT"}
{"query": "edit a slack message I sent earlier", "tool_slug": "SLACK_UPDATES_A_SLACK_MESSAGE"}
{"query": "create a new event on my calendar", "tool_slug": "GOOGLECALENDAR_CREATE_EVENT"}
```

You don't load this yourself. You **point the config at the file** — `source_kind:
jsonl` tells the SDK it's a JSONL file, and `path` is where to find it (relative
to where you run from, or absolute):

```yaml
data:
  source_kind: jsonl
  path: examples/sft_walkthrough/data/train.jsonl
```

The SDK reads the file through a **data store** and hands the rows to the next
stage. At this point they're still raw dicts — `{"query": ..., "tool_slug": ...}`.

## 2. The transform — shape raw rows into a chat conversation [#2-the-transform--shape-raw-rows-into-a-chat-conversation]

An algorithm doesn't train on arbitrary dicts. SFT trains on a
&#x2A;*`ChatMessagesRow`** — a conversation of `{role, content}` messages. A
**transform** bridges the two.

A transform is just a function with one contract: &#x2A;*`rows -> rows`**. You list
transforms in the config and they run in order. The built-in `jsonl_to_chat`
renders each raw dict into a chat turn using templates you provide:

```yaml
transforms:
  - kind: jsonl_to_chat
    params:
      system_prompt: "You select the single best tool for the user's query."
      user_template: "Query: {query}\nReply with the tool slug inside <answer></answer>."
      assistant_template: "<answer>{tool_slug}</answer>"
```

So this raw row:

```json
{"query": "edit a slack message I sent earlier", "tool_slug": "SLACK_UPDATES_A_SLACK_MESSAGE"}
```

becomes this `ChatMessagesRow`:

```json
{ "messages": [
  { "role": "system",    "content": "You select the single best tool for the user's query." },
  { "role": "user",      "content": "Query: edit a slack message I sent earlier\nReply with the tool slug inside <answer></answer>." },
  { "role": "assistant", "content": "<answer>SLACK_UPDATES_A_SLACK_MESSAGE</answer>" }
] }
```

The conversation carries **only data** — it does *not* say which tokens to learn
from. That's the algorithm's decision (next step).

<Callout title="Registering your own transform">
  When no built-in fits, write your own and reference it by `kind` — no SDK fork:

  ```python
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  from evsys_sdk import register_transform

  @register_transform("strip_pii")          # ← the name you use in the config
  class StripPII:
      name = "strip_pii"
      class Config(BaseModel, extra="forbid"):
          field: str = "query"
      def __init__(self, **kw): self.cfg = self.Config(**kw)
      def __call__(self, rows):              # ← the rows -> rows contract
          for r in rows:
              r[self.cfg.field] = redact(r[self.cfg.field])
          return rows
  ```

  Then add `{ kind: strip_pii, params: { field: query } }` to `transforms`. The
  SDK finds it in the registry by that name. See [Extensibility](/docs/concepts/extensibility).
</Callout>

## 3. The built-in `sft` algorithm [#3-the-built-in-sft-algorithm]

You don't implement training — you select a built-in algorithm by `kind` and
pass its knobs. `sft&#x60; tokenizes each chat row (masking the loss to the assistant
turns) and runs the SDK training loop on the hosted &#x2A;*`tinker`** backend:

```yaml
model:
  name: Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B
backend:
  kind: tinker
algorithm:
  kind: sft
  params:
    learning_rate: 1.0e-4
    max_steps: 2            # bump to 100-500 for a real run
    batch_size: 1
    lora_rank: 1
    supervise: all_assistant   # which turns carry a loss — the ALGORITHM's call
```

`supervise: all_assistant` is what makes this *supervised* — the loss is on the
assistant tokens (the `<answer>…</answer>`), not the prompt. Note this lives on
the **algorithm**, not the data: the same chat rows could be used differently by
another algorithm.

## 4. Benchmarks & validation — score the model *during* training [#4-benchmarks--validation--score-the-model-during-training]

To know if training is working, you score the model against a held-out
**benchmark** while it trains. A benchmark is a **directory** containing a
`tasks.jsonl` — each task has an `instruction` (the full prompt) and a
**verifier** that says whether an answer is correct:

```json title="examples/sft_walkthrough/data/val/tasks.jsonl"
{"task_id": "val_0", "instruction": "Query: schedule a meeting on my calendar\nReply with the tool slug inside <answer></answer>.", "verifier": {"kind": "in_process", "fn_name": "contains", "expected": "<answer>GOOGLECALENDAR_CREATE_EVENT</answer>"}}
```

You attach it under `metadata.benchmark&#x60; and give it a &#x2A;*`run_every`** so it's
scored **in-loop, repeatedly, every N steps**:

```yaml
metadata:
  benchmark:
    - name: val
      path: examples/sft_walkthrough/data/val   # the DIRECTORY (holds tasks.jsonl)
      run_every: 1          # score every step. Use 50 / 100 for longer runs.
      metrics: [pass@1]      # fraction of tasks the model gets right
      split: val            # tags the metrics as validation (vs a `test` benchmark)
      max_tokens: 64
```

Two **independent** knobs to understand:

* **`run_every` controls *when* it's scored.** `run_every: N` scores the
  benchmark **in-loop every N steps** during training; omit `run_every` and it's
  scored **once, after training**. (This is true of any entry — a `test`
  benchmark can have a `run_every` and run in-loop too.)
* **`split` (`val` / `test`) is just a label** — it namespaces the metrics so
  different benchmarks' scores stay apart in the logs; it does *not* decide when
  an entry runs. `pass@1` here = the fraction of tasks whose answer the verifier
  accepts (contains the right `<answer>SLUG</answer>`).

## 5. Local logging — where the metrics show up [#5-local-logging--where-the-metrics-show-up]

Logging is a **callback** on the experiment. `local_logger` prints a per-step
line and writes the metrics to disk:

```yaml
callbacks:
  - kind: local_logger
    params:
      print_every: 1
```

It writes to &#x2A;*`<output_dir>/<run_name>/`**, which the runner sets to
`examples/sft_walkthrough/outputs/sft_tool_selection/`:

| File                    | What's in it                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `metrics.jsonl`         | one row per event — `{step, split, metrics}`. **Train** steps are tagged `split: "train"`; the in-loop **validation** scores are tagged `split: "val"` (so you can tell them apart). |
| `predictions/val.jsonl` | the model's actual answer for each val task each time it's scored                                                                                                                    |
| `summary.md`            | final status + the per-eval metric lines, written at the end                                                                                                                         |

A typical `metrics.jsonl` looks like:

Each row is `{step, split, metrics}` — training steps are tagged
`split: "train"` and the in-loop validation scores are tagged `split: "val"`, so
both live in one file:

```json
{"step": 1, "split": "train", "metrics": {"train_mean_nll": ..., "optim/lr": ...}}
{"step": 1, "split": "val",   "metrics": {"val/val/pass@1": ...}}
```

You read training loss and validation score side by side, scored in-loop.

## 6. Run it [#6-run-it]

Everything above is the file `examples/sft_walkthrough/config.yaml`. The runner
just loads it and calls the SDK:

```bash
# offline — checks every kind/params block, no GPU/network/cost:
evsys validate examples/sft_walkthrough/config.yaml --deep

# real hosted training (needs a Tinker key, charges a small amount):
export TINKER_API_KEY=...
python examples/sft_walkthrough/run.py
```

```text
Status:     completed
Artifacts:  ['run_dir', 'checkpoint-final', 'state-final', ...]
Conclusion: 1/1 arms completed.
Logs:       examples/sft_walkthrough/outputs — metrics.jsonl, predictions/, summary.md, experiment.md
```

The runner uses `Experiment(cfg).run()` (not the bare `run_experiment`) so the
`local_logger` callback fires and writes the files above — including
`experiment.md` with the hypothesis and conclusion.

You get a LoRA adapter that emits the tool slug, plus the `metrics.jsonl` /
`predictions/` / `summary.md` from step 5. Bump `max_steps` and grow the val set
for a run that actually moves the needle.
